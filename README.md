# MHIT36

Multi-GPU code for intreface-resolved simulations of multiphase turbulence.
The code relies on direct numerical simulation of Navier-Stokes equations coupled with a phase-field method (ACDI) for interface description.
The code parallerelization relies on the cuDecomp library.

## How to run the code
- **Compile the cuDecomp library** using `*_lib.sh`.  
  - The resulting modules and libraries will be located in:  
    - `cuDecomp/build/lib`  
    - `cuDecomp/build/include`  
  - Alternatively, you can compile manually using the **CMake** setup provided in the cuDecomp repository.  
- **Verify the cuDecomp build** to ensure it compiled correctly (must be built using **HPC-SDK**).  
- **Folder `multi/`**: contains the source code for the multi-GPU version of the code.  
  - Use one of the scripts (`local.sh`, `leo.sh`, or `mn5.sh`) to compile and run.  
- **Autotuning (default mode):**  
  - By default, the code is set to full autotuning (`pr=0`, `pc=0`).  
  - cuDecomp will automatically determine the best decomposition at runtime, based only on the total number of tasks.  
  - This means recompilation is **not required** when changing the number of MPI processes.  
  - The backend is also selected automatically.  
- **Phase-field module (optional):**  
  - Controlled via a conditional compilation flag.  
  - By default, only the single-phase version is enabled.
